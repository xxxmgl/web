Client name: Huawei European Town Project Type: Shanghai headquarters office design and decoration

Site: Dongguan Building area: 3230 square meters

Our company is very honored to complete the office desigan project of Huawei European town. This project not only reflects our company's design concept and professional ability, but also shows our innovative spirit and emphasis on humanity.

In the design of Huawei headquarters, we fully considered the needs and comfort of employees, and combined modern office facilities with classical architectural style to create a working environment that is both artistic and practical.

Inspired by classical European architecture, we divide the campus into 12 theme areas, each of which is designed based on its own characteristic architecture, so that employees can also feel a strong humanistic atmosphere in their work.

In addition, we also pay attention to environmental protection and sustainable development, and strive to achieve energy saving and environmental protection in building design and material selection. Green building materials are widely used in the park to make full use of natural light and ventilation, reducing energy consumption.

At the same time, we also planted a large number of plants, creating a pleasant ecological environment.

The office design project of Huawei European Town is one of the representative works of our company, which fully demonstrates our professional ability and innovative spirit.

We will continue to work hard to create more excellent office environments for our customers to meet their needs and exceed their expectations.
