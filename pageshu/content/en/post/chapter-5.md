The first offline experience center for Taiwan's high-end evening gown and shapewear brand in Shanghai. The overall design concept of the space is inspired by the local Shanghai sea culture, and is developed and extended in the most Shanghai-oriented ARTDECO style. A large number of metal lines highlight the vintage and gorgeousness of the products. The whole space adopts warm color as the main tone, combining the showroom and office part organically. The unique lighting design creates rich decorations and embellishments, and highlights the carefully arranged art installations around the space.
